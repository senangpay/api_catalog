# Integration API

An integration API (Application Programming Interface) is a collection of protocols and tools designed to enable different software applications to interact and function together seamlessly. It specifies the methods and data formats for requesting and exchanging information, providing a standardized framework for integrating various systems.

This allows developers to link diverse software solutions, automate workflows, and ensure smooth data transfer across platforms. As a result, businesses can streamline operations, enhance functionality, and boost overall efficiency.
